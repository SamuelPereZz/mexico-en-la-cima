Highlighting tourism in rural populations is essential to boost their economic growth, however, there is little tourism diffusion that includes this sector. For this reason, we have developed a web platform that disseminates tourism in rural populations of Mexico, which is aimed at travelers who seek to experience the cultural diversity of the country.
